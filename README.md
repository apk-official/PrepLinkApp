# PrepLink

PrepLink is a personal interview preparation project aimed at helping interviewees prepare more effectively for job interviews.

Instead of relying on generic interview questions, PrepLink focuses on tailored preparation based on the role and the company the user is applying for.

## What is PrepLink?

PrepLink helps users generate structured interview preparation using real information from their job application process.

The user provides:
- Their resume
- The job description
- The official company website URL

Using this information, PrepLink generates:
- Role-specific interview questions
- AI-suggested answers aligned with the user’s background
- Practical interview tips
- A brief overview of the company, including its mission, vision, and values

## Why this project?

I personally found interview preparation difficult, especially when it came to knowing where to start. From my experience, many interviewees struggle with:
- understanding how to prepare based on a job description,
- knowing how to frame answers that match the role, and
- doing proper company research beyond just skimming the website.

Preparation often feels unstructured, with people jumping between generic interview questions, job descriptions, and company pages without clear direction.

PrepLink was created to bring everything into one place. By combining the candidate’s resume, the job description, and the company’s official website, the project aims to provide focused and role-specific interview preparation instead of one-size-fits-all content.

## Project Structure

This project is built as a full-stack application and is split into two repositories:

- Frontend Repository – Handles the user interface and user interactions
- Backend Repository – Manages APIs, authentication, and AI-related processing

Together, these repositories make up the PrepLink application.
